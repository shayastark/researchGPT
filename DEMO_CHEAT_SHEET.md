## 📱 BEST DEMO QUERIES

### Option 1: Cheapest ($0.01) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```
"What's the weather in New York?"
```
- Only costs $0.01 USDC
- Fast response
- Shows full payment flow

### Option 2: Crypto Focus ($0.50-$1.00)
```
"Give me technical analysis for Bitcoin"
```
or
```
"What are some promising crypto gems?"
```

### Option 3: Multi-Tool (Show Autonomy)
```
"Give me a complete crypto market analysis"
```
- Claude calls multiple tools
- Shows autonomous decision-making

## 🎤 30-SECOND PITCH

> "I built an autonomous AI agent that uses the **x402 payment protocol** to access premium data. Users message it via **XMTP**, **Claude** autonomously decides which paid services to use, and **Locus** handles payments with policy enforcement on **Base**. Watch what happens when I ask about weather..."

[Send message via XMTP]

> "Claude just chose the weather tool, attempted the x402 payment, and [got data back / showed payment negotiation]. The user didn't need an API key, account, or crypto knowledge - just a message."

---

## 🏆 KEY TALKING POINTS

**✅ True Autonomy**
"Claude decides which tools to use - there's no hardcoded logic"

**✅ x402 Protocol** 
"Decentralized payment discovery - endpoints tell the agent what they cost"

**✅ Multi-Facilitator**
"Works with both Locus and CDP facilitators seamlessly"

**✅ Policy Enforcement**
"Locus provides spending guardrails - operates autonomously but safely"

**✅ Simple UX**
"Users just send a message - no crypto knowledge needed"

---

## 📊 IF FUNDED (Best Case)

**What Judges See:**
```
Terminal: "💰 Making x402 payment call..."
Terminal: "✅ weather_data completed"
XMTP: [Agent responds with real weather data]
```

**What to Say:**
> "The payment just happened automatically on Base using USDC. Check the Locus dashboard - you'll see the transaction and remaining budget."

---

## 📊 IF NOT FUNDED (Still Great!)

**What Judges See:**
```
Terminal: "💰 Making x402 payment call..."
Terminal: "💳 Payment required for weather_data"
Terminal: "📋 Payment info: {...Base USDC details...}"
XMTP: [Agent provides helpful response anyway]
```

**What to Say:**
> "Perfect! You're seeing the x402 protocol negotiation. The endpoint just told us it wants 0.01 USDC on Base, sent to this address. This is the decentralized payment discovery - the agent can discover ANY x402 service's price without pre-configuration."

---

## 🎯 THREE TRACKS = ONE DEMO

**CDP x402:** ✅ x402 protocol + Base USDC payments  
**Locus:** ✅ Policy enforcement + multi-facilitator  
**XMTP:** ✅ Agent SDK + conversational interface

---

## 💰 QUICK WALLET FUNDING (Optional)

**To enable full demo:**
1. Go to app.paywithlocus.com
2. Fund wallet with $1-2 USDC on Base
3. Verify approved endpoints
4. Test with weather query first ($0.01)

**Where to get Base USDC:**
- Coinbase (withdraw to Base)
- Base bridge from Ethereum
- Base faucet (testnet only)

## 🎬 DEMO FLOW (2 MINUTES)

**0:00-0:30** - Intro pitch (above)  
**0:30-1:00** - Send message via XMTP  
**1:00-1:30** - Show agent processing logs  
**1:30-1:45** - Show response to user  
**1:45-2:00** - Show Locus dashboard  

---

## 🚨 IF THINGS GO WRONG

**Agent crashes?**
> "Railway provides health checks and auto-restarts" [restart agent]

**Slow response?**
> "XMTP is decentralized, so latency varies. But notice end-to-end encryption."

**All endpoints fail?**
> "This shows the robustness - Claude handles failures gracefully and still provides value."

---

## 📞 LIKELY JUDGE QUESTIONS

**Q: "How does it know which tool to use?"**  
A: "Claude's function calling. I define tool descriptions, Claude reads the user query and picks the right one. No hardcoded logic."

**Q: "What if the agent spends too much?"**  
A: "Locus policy groups enforce budget limits. Set monthly caps, per-transaction limits, and approved endpoints only."

**Q: "Can it work with any x402 service?"**  
A: "Yes! Add the endpoint to the approved list and Claude can discover and use it. The x402 protocol standardizes payment negotiation."

**Q: "How much does a query cost?"**  
A: "Depends on tools used. Weather is $0.01, technical analysis is $0.50, crypto gems is $1.00. Agent tries to minimize costs."

## ⚡ CLOSING LINE

> "This shows what's possible when conversational AI meets decentralized payments. Users get premium data through natural language, agents operate safely, and providers get paid - no centralized intermediaries."

---

**YOU GOT THIS! 🚀**

Remember: x402 payment negotiation is impressive even without actual payment!
