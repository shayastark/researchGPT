## 🔑 Key Technical Details

### XMTP Agent (`src/agent/index.ts`)

**Key APIs Used:**
- `Agent.create(signer, options)` - Creates agent
- `agent.on('text', handler)` - Handles text messages
- `filter.fromSelf()`, `filter.hasContent()` - Message filtering
- `filter.isDM()`, `filter.isGroup()` - Conversation type detection
- `ctx.sendText()` - Send responses

**Important Notes:**
- InboxId is **automatically derived** from wallet address (don't need to generate/store it)
- Encryption key is required for database encryption
- Uses Railway volume for persistent database in production

### x402 Services (`src/services/*.ts`)

**Key APIs Used:**
- `paymentMiddleware(address, routes, facilitatorConfig)` - Protects endpoints
- Routes require payment before returning data
- Automatic payment verification and settlement

**Current Implementation:**
- Returns mock data (TODO: integrate real APIs)
- Prices: $0.10, $0.15, $0.20 USDC
- Testnet uses x402.org facilitator (free)
- Mainnet uses CDP facilitator (requires API keys)

### x402 Client (`src/lib/x402-client.ts`)

**Key APIs Used:**
- `wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, account)` - Wraps fetch with payment handling
- Automatically handles 402 responses and payment flow
- Returns both data and payment response

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### Immediate (User's Next Steps)
1. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Deploy 3 x402 services (market, sentiment, onchain)
   - Deploy XMTP agent
   - Set all environment variables
   - Get testnet USDC from https://faucet.circle.com/

2. **Test the Agent:**
   - Send XMTP message to agent address
   - Verify payment flow works
   - Check logs for any issues

### Future Enhancements (For Agent to Help With)

## 🔧 Known Technical Details

### XMTP SDK Changes
- **Old approach:** Used `createUser()`, `createSigner()` directly from main package
- **New approach:** Import from `@xmtp/agent-sdk/user` submodule
- **Reason:** ESM/CJS compatibility with v1.1.14

### x402 SDK Changes
- **Old version:** 0.1.x (didn't exist)
- **New version:** 0.7.x (official release)
- **Key difference:** Simplified API, removed complex config schemas

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Module:** NodeNext (required for ESM compatibility)
- **Module Resolution:** NodeNext
- **Skip Lib Check:** true (to avoid type conflicts)

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Mock Data:** Services return fake data - need real API integration
2. **No Caching:** Every query costs money, even for same data
3. **No Rate Limiting:** Users can spam queries
4. **No Authentication:** Anyone can message the agent

### Not Issues (Common Misconceptions):
- ❌ "Need to generate inboxId manually" - **False**, it's automatic
- ❌ "Need CDP keys for testnet" - **False**, only for mainnet
- ❌ "Services need complex config schemas" - **False**, simplified in v0.7.x

## 🌐 XMTP Network Issue (FIXED)

### Problem:
Users trying to message the agent on xmtp.chat got error:
```
"Unable to get inbox ID for address. Try again."
```

### Root Cause:
**Network mismatch!** XMTP has separate networks:
- **DEV network** (`XMTP_ENV=dev`) - For development
- **PRODUCTION network** (`XMTP_ENV=production`) - For real users

**xmtp.chat uses PRODUCTION**, but the agent was likely on DEV. These are completely separate - like different phone networks.

### Solution:
1. **Check which network you're on:**
   ```bash
   npm run check-network
   ```

2. **Initialize on production:**
   ```bash
   npm run initialize-production
   ```

3. **Update environment:**
   ```env
   XMTP_ENV=production  # Must be production for xmtp.chat!
   ```

4. **Start agent:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### New Tools Added:
- `npm run check-network` - Check which XMTP networks your agent is registered on
- `npm run initialize-production` - Initialize agent on production network
- Enhanced logging to warn if on wrong network
- New documentation: `NETWORK_SETUP.md`

### Prevention:
- Agent now displays clear warnings if on DEV network
- Logs show which network is active on startup
- Documentation clarified the network distinction

## 🔧 Railway ESM Deployment Issue (FIXED)

### Problem:
Railway deployment failed with error:
```
Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: No "exports" main defined in 
/app/node_modules/@xmtp/agent-sdk/package.json
```

### Root Cause:
`@xmtp/agent-sdk` is an ESM-only package, but `package.json` was missing `"type": "module"` declaration.

### Solution:
Added to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

This tells Node.js to treat all `.js` files as ES modules, which is required for the XMTP Agent SDK.

### Also Updated:
- `tsconfig.json` - Added `ts-node` ESM configuration
- All npm scripts - Updated to use ESM loader for development
- Kept `npm start` simple for Railway production deployment

## 💡 Tips for Next Agent

### When User Asks About Deployment:
- Check `DEPLOYMENT.md` for Railway-specific instructions
- Remind about testnet USDC from Circle faucet
- Verify all environment variables are set

### When User Asks About Adding Features:
- Real API integration is the highest priority
- Check existing service structure in `src/services/*.ts`
- Maintain x402 payment flow (don't break it)

### When User Reports Errors:
- **"Unable to get inbox ID"** - Check XMTP network mismatch (use `npm run check-network`)
- Check if it's an environment variable issue
- Verify USDC balance in wallet
- Check Railway logs for specific errors
- Look for network issues (RPC, facilitator)

### When User Wants to Go to Production:
- Switch `XMTP_ENV=production`
- Switch `USE_MAINNET=true`
- Add CDP API keys
- Update RPC URL to mainnet
- Fund wallet with real USDC
